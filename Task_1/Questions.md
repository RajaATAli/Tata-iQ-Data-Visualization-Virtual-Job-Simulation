## CMO Questions:

2. What times of day (from the InvoiceDate) do we see the highest sales volume, and can this inform our marketing and promotional efforts?
3. Are there any specific products (from StockCode) that generate higher sales during certain times and how can we leverage this information for marketing campaigns?
4. Do some groups of customers based on their demographic data (from Country and CustomerID) tend to buy certain products more than others, and how can we better market to these groups?
