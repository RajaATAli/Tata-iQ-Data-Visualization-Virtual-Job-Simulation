## Programme Duration and Role

Over the course of `one week`, I played the role of a `Data Visualization Analyst` at Tata iQ. This programme provided me with the opportunity to address the needs of various stakeholders, interact with end-users, understand their objectives, and create dashboards or visualizations to help them derive valuable insights from their data.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario

**Objective:** Prepare Questions for CEO and CMO Meeting

In this task, I anticipated and prepared insightful questions from the perspectives of the CEO and CMO, based on a given dataset, to facilitate strategic business discussions in an upcoming meeting.

**What I learned in this task:**
- Enhanced my critical thinking and data interpretation skills
- Developed business acumen and communication skills
- Gained specific insights into the business operations of Tata iQ and the retail industry.

### Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals

**Objective:** Choosing the right visual representations of key business metrics, as requested by the CEO, to facilitate effective decision-making and strategic planning in the online retail company.

ps. There was no deliverable for this task, only a set of questions and quizzes to guide my thought process.

**What I learned in this task:**
- Understanding the `Grammar of Graphics` for Effective Data Visualization
- The concept of `Datasauras Dozen` and `Anscombe's quartet` and why it is important to always visualize data.
- Examined Global CO2 Emissions Patterns using Data Visualization Techniques with Plotnine and the Grammar of Graphics Framework `(I undertook this project as a side project to strengthen my concepts, and it can be found in the repository under Task_2 and was not required for the completion of the programme)`
- How to choose the right chart for Data Visualization


### Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals

**Objective:** Create informative and actionable visuals using `Tableau` to aid in executive decision-making, focusing on revenue trends, country-specific revenues, customer segmentation, and product demand

I used the `Online Retail Data Set.xlsx` to complete this task.

**What I learned in this task:**
- Navigating and Using the `Tableau interface`
- `Data cleaning and preparation` using Tableau, by implementing `filters` at the data source level for consistency across all visualizations.
- Manipulating Time-series data using Tableau
- Creating calculated fields and parameters in Tableau
