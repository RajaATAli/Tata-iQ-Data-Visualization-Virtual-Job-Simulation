## Programme Duration and Role

Over the course of `one week`, I played the role of a `Data Visualization Analyst` at Tata iQ. This programme provided me with the opportunity to address the needs of various stakeholders, interact with end-users, understand their objectives, and create dashboards or visualizations to help them derive valuable insights from their data.

## Tasks Overview
